Final exam is a crucial step to get accepted in 1337 / well, it's better to get prepared for it.
I'll try to duplicate the exam I've passed with the same code I used before.
For your side, try to get inspired and code with your own logic
A very good advice is to try to make in place the logic of the exercice, then you can code it by your own and your uniq style.</br>
`SO LOGIC 1st => CODE 2end`</br>
#** THE MOST CRUCIAL TIP: </br>
`EAT WELL + SLEEP WELL = WORK HARD = SUCCESS`
